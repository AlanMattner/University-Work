// Notes on Git commands


Overview of steps

	1. Copy contents of the remote repository to your local repository
	2. Configure a branch for developing a feature
	3. Make any changes to the local repository e.g. adding classes
	4. Copy the changes to the remote repository
	9. Merge branches when ready



Creating a Local Repo and Connecting with the Remote Repo

	1. Navigate to a folder in a command line window which you wish to make a git repository and enter the command
		git init

	2. Now you need to let your local repository know about the remote one on GitLab. THis can be achieved by entering the following command:
		git remote add <shortphrase> <<ssh_url>>



Copying the Remote Repo
	
	1. git pull <shortphrase> <branch>

	2. The '<shortphrase> <branch>' is necessary to identify the branch of the remote repository you wish to access

	3. Best practice is to pull before you start working, to make sure you've got the most recent version of the code



Setting up a branch

	1. git checkout -b <branch_name>
		Checkout moves git to the branch specified. -b creates a new branch. <branch_name> is the name of the branch.

	2. git push <shortphrase> <branch_name>
		Push will push the active branch back up to the repository specified by <branch_name> <shortphrase>

	3. git checkout <branch_name>
		This will simpy change which branch you are working on.



Making a change in a local repository and pushing to the Remote Repo

	1. Create a new file in the local directory

	2. Identify the file to be included in the next commit (to be staged) by using the following command
		git add <filename>

	3. Then commit the changes
		git commit -m "This is a comment describing what your commit includes"

	4. Push the changes to the remote repo's <<branch_name>> branch
		git push -u <shortphrase> <<branch_name>>

		using -u means any future pull will attempt to bring in any commits from the remote branch



Merging branches

	1. Git checkout <branch_name>
		move to the branch you want to merge into the target branch

	2. Git merge <branch_name>
		merge into <branch_name>
